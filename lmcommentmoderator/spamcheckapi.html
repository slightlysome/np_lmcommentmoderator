<h3>NP_LMCommentModerator SpamCheck API overview</h3>

<p>
The NP_LMCommentModerator SpamCheck API makes it possible to extend the comment spam handling abilities of the 
<a href="http://nucleus.slightlysome.net/plugins/lmcommentmoderator">NP_LMCommentModerator</a> plugin 
by creating Nucleus plugins that subscribe to the spam check events triggered by the NP_LMCommentModerator plugin.
</p>

<p>
The NP_LMCommentModerator plugin implements a modified subset of the <a href="http://wakka.xiffy.nl/spamcheck_api">Nucleus CMS SpamCheck API</a>. 
The reason for using a modified version is that the Nucleus CMS SpamCheck API data structures are missing some 
data that is needed by the spam handling in the NP_LMCommentModerator plugin. 
</p>

<p>
A spam check plugin can categorize a comment in 3 different categories:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Spam</b> - Comments that the spam check plugin is certain are spam is categorized as <code>Spam</code>.
<li><b>Ham</b> - Comments that the spam check plugin is certain are genuine comments is categorized as <code>Ham</code>.
<li><b>Undecided</b> - Comments that the spam check plugin can't categorize as <code>Ham</code> or <code>Spam</code> is categorized as <code>Undecided</code>.
</ul>

<h3>The LMCommentModerator_SpamCheck event</h3>

<p>
Spam check plugins must implement and subscribe to the <code>LMCommentModerator_SpamCheck</code> event. 
The <code>$data</code> parameter for this event contains a <code>spamcheck</code> member.
It is an associated array which contain data that can be used by the spam check plugin. The members of this associated array are:
</p>

<ul>

 </li>
<li><b>plugin</b> - If the <code>result</code> is set, is the name of the spam check plugin returned here.
</li>
<li><b>message</b> - If the <code>result</code> is set, is a reason for the categorization returned here.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If the <code>result</code> attribute is already set in the <code>spamcheck</code> array when the event is 
triggered in a spam check plugin must the spam check plugin ignore the spam check and return without updating any result attributes.
</p>

<p>
If no spam check plugins categorize the comment as <code>Ham</code> or <code>Spam</code>, will the NP_LMCommentModerator plugin 
assign the <code>Manual Moderation</code> category the comment.
